# Read in the data from the CSV. Data comes in very tall and narrow.
# For each visit to the city's website, many observations are made
# (one for each collection area in each district). 
# dcast must be used to reshape the data

# Remove consecutive duplicate entries (ignoring differences in timestamp)
#  Done by using a slick hack with rowMeans and booleans. Essentially,
#  the first row is demanded with c(TRUE,...), and all other rows are 
#  compared to their subsequent neighbor (ignoring the first column)
#  and if there are any differences between the neighbors, this row is
#  also kept. Otherwise, it is dropped. To apply this trick, all NA 
#  values must be temporarily switched out with "NA" placeholders, and
#  reverted to NA values afterward.

#  is not equal to "Current", but followed by a "Current" in the

#  a cumsum is taken over that column, which gives a column that
