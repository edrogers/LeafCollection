# Remove consecutive duplicate entries (ignoring differences in timestamp)
#  Done by using a slick hack with rowMeans and booleans. Essentially,
#  the first row is demanded with c(TRUE,...), and all other rows are 
#  compared to their subsequent neighbor (ignoring the first column)
#  and if there are any differences between the neighbors, this row is
#  also kept. Otherwise, it is dropped. To apply this trick, all NA 
#  values must be temporarily switched out with "NA" placeholders, and
#  reverted to NA values afterward.
